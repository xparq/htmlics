See the header comment in `htmlics.php`!

(BTW, today I learned about [hyperscript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript).
I was like all :DDD when I realized that they basically did the same, only for JS
(and, well, with a bit more typing... ;-p )! Well done, both of us! ;) Nah, just
kidding: no kudos for this mostly trivial convenience stuff of mine.)

##### NOTE: #####

* I've only added a few common HTML tags, on demand, as I needed.
  Then I got bored and moved on. ;)
  Adding more is trivial, so anyone can continue where I left off.

* I'll probably come back, though, and roll it further, as soon as I'll actually
  start using this thing *in vivo*...
